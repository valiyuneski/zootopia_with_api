# Animals Web Generator 🐾

This project fetches information about animals from the [API Ninjas Animals API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/animals) and generates a clean, ready-to-open **HTML page** (`animals.html`) with the results.  
It was built as part of a milestone project to practice working with APIs, error handling, and generating dynamic web content from Python.

## Features
- Fetches animal data directly from the API.  
- Supports user input: enter any animal name and get information back.  
- Displays taxonomy, locations, and characteristics in a styled HTML page.  
- Handles errors gracefully:
  - If the animal doesn’t exist, a friendly message is displayed in the generated page.
